The pictures shown in the gallery are all saved in the "images" folder. The pictures files are fetched from that folder with an api.

Since there is a server-side function, the file cannot be run directly from browser.
It needs to be run through server (e.g. http, node, etc)
To run on server, server.mjs file needs to be run in command prompt from its directory with the command like "node server.mjs".
After that, the contents can be found on localhost:3000.
